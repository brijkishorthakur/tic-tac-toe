# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbol, either "X" or "O". The goal is to be the first to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
